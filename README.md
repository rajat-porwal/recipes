# recipes
A toy HTML Website to showcase recipes. Clicking on a recipe link will show the instructions and ingredients required to make the dish.

Here I will be making use of the skills I learned while getting myself started with HTML like working with texts, lists, links and putting in images and create a working Recipe website.

## Afterthoughts ðŸ’­
I learned how to fill out the HTML boilerplate, create directory and files, navigate through the terminal, input headers, paragraphs, images, and links. Alongside, I was able to create ordered and unordered lists for my recipes. Most importantly, I was able to organize "beginner friendly" clean code so it is readable and understandable to any viewer.
